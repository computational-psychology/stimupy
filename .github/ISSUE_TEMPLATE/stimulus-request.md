## What stimulus would you like?
A clear and concise description of what it should look like.
Please attach images/drawings to illustrate.
If a citation for this stimulus is available, please also mention it.

## What are the relevant stimulus parameters?
Since `stimupy` stimuli are fully parameterizable,
please briefly describe what parameters you'd like this new function to have,
and what their expected behavior is.

*NOTE*: if you want only a single parameterization (aside from resolution),
that does not fit within the scope a new stimulus function
-- instead, please request a new stimulus *set*.

## Is the stimulus is similar to an existing `stimupy` stimulus?
If so, please describe the *differences* between the existing stimulus,
and the proposed one
-- especially the difference in behavior for parameters.

## Describe alternatives you've considered
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.
