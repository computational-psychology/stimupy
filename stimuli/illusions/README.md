## Illusions

This directory contains modules for creating various brightness illusions. 
Each module contains a function to create the general version of the illusion with suitable default parameters.
Beside that, in each module one can find the implementations of functions for generating illusions used in published papers.
These functions are the one being called from the modules in `papers` directory.

An overview of all illusions can be generated by running the `overview.py` module.
Each functions returns a `Stimulus` object. `img` attribute contains a 2D numpy array
representing the illusion and `target_mask` attribute contains an integer mask specifying
the location of target patches inside the illusion.
### Example usage
```python
from stimuli import illusions, utils
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

stimulus = illusions.whites.white()
utils.plot_stim(stimulus, mask=True)
plt.show()
```
