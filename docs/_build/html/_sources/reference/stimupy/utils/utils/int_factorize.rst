=============



.. py:function:: stimupy.utils.utils.int_factorize(n)


   All integer factors of integer n

   All integer factors, i.e., all integers that n is integer-divisible by.
   Also not a very efficient algorithm (brute force trial division),
   so should only be used as a helpter function.

   :param n: number to factorize
   :type n: int

   :returns: set of all integer factors of n
   :rtype: set
